# Benchmark playground
Implementations of various tasks under different languages with benchmarks for fun and profit. This is primarily an exercise for timing very small and specific bits of contrived logic in various languages. The goal is compact code, minimal overhead, and measuring how much time elapses from a single cold pass.

Don't expect too much ryhm or reason in there. There's the bare minimum error checking, and no tests since these are contrived exercises.

There *might* be useful as references for bare bones implemenations but that's certainly not the goal.

####NOTE: These are microbenchmarks and are being done of pure curiosty ... DO NOT READ TOO MUCH INTO THESE!!! These mean little to nothing in any context other than these very short test implementations.
